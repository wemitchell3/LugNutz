## Project links to Initial Proposale, Mock Up, and ERD. 

This project was designed and styled as a mobile webapp. Some responsive design has been implemented but the app is not intended to be a desktop app. Please open developer tools and set the view window as the size of a mobile device.

This project was designed using React [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with Reactstrap [Reactstrap your App](https://reactstrap.github.io).

Initial Proposal [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JCqUH8-aP45Fvkd4Otpiu9TVqvYY-DdIEzfp0LAK6o/edit#heading=h.p9bkn4ry851p](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JCqUH8-aP45Fvkd4Otpiu9TVqvYY-DdIEzfp0LAK6o/edit#heading=h.p9bkn4ry851p)<br>

Mock Up[https://app.moqups.com/E4SvJVXrf7/edit/page/a777bf3ae](https://app.moqups.com/E4SvJVXrf7/edit/page/a777bf3ae)<br>

ERD [https://dbdiagram.io/d/5cc35758f7c5bb70c72fc5c7](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5cc35758f7c5bb70c72fc5c7)<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

In the root directory, type npm start. This runs the app in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Open developer tools and set view port to the size of a mobile device.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Start JSON Sever`

In the lugnutz/api folder type: json-server -p 8088 -w lugnutz.json. This will start the JSON database for the project.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
